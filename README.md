python-utilities
================
A List of a few utlities I use for my everyday work.

1. Coursera.py
==============

Given a coursera url , It will download all the videos from the site.

Instructions 
============

Change the URL inside the python file and the folder name and just run the file.

2. url-download.py 
======================

Given a URL, This utility will download the webpage and also the assets in the webpage. This is still a work in progress and any help is welcome.
For now it would work only with asset urls like /static/js/somefile.js and only on .com or .org sites

Dependencies
============

replace_file.py -- A utility that when given a file and pattern to find and replace will execute it.
